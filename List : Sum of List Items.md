# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program

```
num=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
total=sum(num)
print("The sum of the numbers in the list is:", total)
```

## Result
Thus, the program is executed successfully.
